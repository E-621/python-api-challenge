Python API Homework
# Fun in the Sun

Using an Open weather API and a Google Maps API, I created a python script to highlight potential vacation spots with user-defined ideal weather.  In this challenge, we randomly selected approximately 500 cities around the world.  Then we obtained the current weather conditions for those cities and calculated conditions based on temperature, wind speed, humidity, and cloudiness.  


Our ideal weather conditions were chosen as follows:

•	Ambient temperature between 75 and 90 degrees Fahrenheit.

•	Wind speed less than 10 mph.

•	Without a cloud in the sky.



Given the above conditions, I then located hotels within 5000 meters of our ideal weather.
